The plot suggests that the Ward algorithm is very stable in its computation time, but it is the slowest for small parcellations. Conversely, GMM and K-means have increasing time penalties, with the former having a sharper decrease in performance. Overall, in terms on computational demands, it seems like K-means would be the best option. "

    "However, while K-means is the fastest, it is important to see how stable are the partitions produced by each algorithm. To determine this, we estimated parcels with each algorithm 10 times, and used the adjusted rand index (RI) to compute the level of agreement between any 2 parcellations across methods. The adjusted rand index estimates the rate at which every pair of nodes in partition A were equally assigned to the same/different parcels on partition B, over all possible changes (e.g. clustered together on A, but separately on B). Because of this, the adjusted rand index is a simple metric that determines the percentage agreement of any two partitions that is agnostic to the labeling scheme.\n",

Specifically, Ward is clearly perfectly stable, GMM is mostly stable (with one exception due to some small random initialization element in the algorithm), and K-means is relatively variable. If stability is a desired feature of the parcellations, then the speed of K-means might not be worth it. \n",

This method relies on eigenvalue decomposition of a distance-based adjacency matrix, which for ~160k vertices is very computationally demanding.
